Introduction

Are you tired of writing the same texts to your Miro widgets over and over again? So are we! Miro templates are nice and super effective, but they are missing a key feature regarding the content. We bring you a solution in a form of variables! While boosting the productivity of daily Miro users, it also makes editing a large board super easy. 

Powered by the latest version of the Miro SDK v2, we have made an app with which you can easily template and replace placeholder texts in your Miro board to make the filling-in of information easy and productive. No longer do you need to drag around a large board selecting elements, instead, with our app you just have to fill in a form, and the app automatically replaces all the placeholder texts into values of your choice.

Our solution is easy to build upon. We have already planned on extending the app by introducing templated images as well as global team-scoped variables.
